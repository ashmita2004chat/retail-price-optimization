# üß† Retail Price Optimization Project

Welcome to the **Retail Price Optimization** project, where we act as a **Pricing Analyst** or **Product Manager** with the goal of identifying optimal price points for a product that balance:

- ‚úÖ Profitability  
- ‚úÖ Customer demand  
- ‚úÖ Conversion potential

This data analytics project uses **regression analysis**, **segmentation**, and **profit simulations** to arrive at actionable pricing strategies.

## üìå Objective

To model and analyze how customers respond to price changes and provide strategic pricing recommendations using:

- üìâ **Price Elasticity Modeling** (Log-Log OLS Regression)
- üîç **Customer Segmentation** (via KMeans Clustering)
- üßÆ **Profit Simulations** at multiple cost margins (60%, 70%, 80%)
- üìä **Visualization Dashboards** for demand, revenue, and pricing behavior
- üìà **Interactive HTML Report** with custom styling & floating Table of Contents

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Used

- **File:** `retail_price.csv`
- **Source:** Synthetic retail dataset adapted for elasticity analysis
- **Key Columns:**
  - `unit_price`
  - `qty` (quantity sold)
  - `total_price` / `revenue`
  - `category`
  - `month_year` / `datetime`

Newly engineered features include:
- `log_price`, `log_qty` 
- `profit_60pct`, `profit_70pct`, `profit_80pct`
- `segment` (via clustering)

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `statsmodels`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn` (KMeans)
- **HTML/CSS** for report customization
- (Optional) Visual Studio Code for HTML design

## üìà Sample Visualizations

> (Add screenshots here if uploading images folder)

- Elasticity by category bar chart
- Profit curve with optimal pricing marker
- Monthly revenue line chart
- Heatmap of quantity sold
- Cluster profiling bar plots

---

## üí° Final Recommendations

- For **bed_bath_table**, the optimal price point was found to be approximately **X.XX** yielding maximum profit.
- Categories like **garden_tools** showed negative elasticity ‚Äî lowering price improves demand and revenue.
- Segment 0 contributes over 40% of total revenue and should be prioritized in targeted pricing strategy.
